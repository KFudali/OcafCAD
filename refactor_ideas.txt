ShapePrototype - PartShape
    Currently the part returns PartPrototype through fetching referred shape from ocaf.
There is no clear way to return modified, located shape of the part from Part class,
other than using its PartLabel. I think the Part interface could expose fetching
something like ShapePrototype (which would always be top-level TopoDS_Shape) and
something like PartShape which would be the ShapePrototype after all assembly level
transformations. This would require specifying ShapePrototype and PartShape wrappers.
